        <p>Dive shops in Dumaguete offer up to four dives each day as well as night dives and Mandarin fish dives. All of the dive spots are designated as 
			protected marine sanctuaries where no boats and fishing activities are allowed. The dive shops in Dumaguete usually collect their diver either at a 
			meeting point in the city, or pick them up from their hotel and bring them back at the end of a fun-filled day of scuba diving. This is the perfect 
			option for visitors who want to spice up their Dumaguete visit with a few dives. Underwater addicts usually prefer to stay in one of the Dive Resorts 
			in Dauin where they can talk “bubbles” 24/7</p>

		<h2>DIVE SITES IN DAUIN – DUMAGUETE</h2>
		<p>Dive sites in Dumaguete are an excellent backdrop for underwater photography as you can find here rare sea creatures and beautiful natural and man-made coral reefs. 
		The sites can be reached either by boat dives or shore dives. The shallow reefs, especially those in the coast lines of Negros Oriental, offer a great opportunity for 
		beginners to make their first breaths under water in a “Discover Scuba Diving” program or to enroll on an open water diver course.</p>
		<p>To enter the sanctuaries, divers need to get off their boats and swim towards the dive sites a few meter. They also need to do the same to get back to their boats. 
		Many dive-sites are also accessible via shore entry.</p>
		<p>Dive guides may adopt new dive plans depending on the sea current which is affected by the particular time of the year, the current tide, or moon phase. Dive guides 
		in Dumaguete are well-experienced and trained on how to cope with this situation and will lead you to a safer part of the dive site. The dive boat will then follow the 
		divers to the particular area which is designated by the guide and will collect the divers accordingly and ensure their safety.</p>

		<h3>Sanctuary Fees in Dumaguete</h3>
		<p>Marine-park fees are charged per dive by the dive site’s local community. Some operators include these fees in their packages while others do not, resulting in variations 
		in pricing. Packages that are initially offered at lower prices may eventually end up being more expensive as you need to shoulder additional fees such as those for the boat, 
		dive guides, and marine-park entrance. You may be better off with an operator that offers a package which includes all these fees.</p>
		
		<h3>Island Hopping in the Visayas</h3>
		<p>You can also enjoy the volcanic islands of Malapascua and Bohol, which are home to a wide array of wildlife, together with your diving activities. Several dive shops in 
		Dumaguete offer island hopping in their itinerary together with diving activities in Dauin. The dive sites in this area are within 15 minutes of travel by speedboat and they 
		can also be reached via shore dives.</p>
