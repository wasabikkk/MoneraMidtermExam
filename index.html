			<br>The city is known colloquially as the "City of Gentle People." Beauty in its gentlest nature can be found in Dumaguete City as it  exudes calmness, ease, and, most noticeably, security.
			<br>The population is slightly more than 100,000 persons, with 30,000 of these being students. Silliman University is the city's most prestigious educational institution, 
			as well as the oldest American private university in the Philippines and the first Protestant school to be founded in a primarily Catholic country.</p>

            <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
            <p>To thoroughly enjoy the province and its culture, schedule your trip around its dry summer season and during their vibrant festivals.</p>
			<h2>Dry and Summer Season | February to June</h2>
			<p>Dumaguete weather is at its best from February to March, the chilly but dry months of the year; and from May to early June, the summer months. If you don't like traveling during the rainy season, avoid going there around October.
			<br>If you don't mind the rain and the closed down tourist spots, you will be able to witness and enjoy one of its famous festivals in the mid of October</p>
			<h2>Festival Season | September to October</h2>
			<p>If you want to see the city in its lively and vibrant form, consider visiting during the time of their festive celebrations. Both locals and international travelers attend street parades and join local games that are exciting and fun to be a part of!
			<br>Two of its most popular celebrations include the Sandurot Festival and Buglasan Festival. This section will describe the festivals and how important it is in helping shape the culture of Dumaguete.</p>
            <ul><li>Sandurot Festival<p>The city holds its Sandurot Festival, which means "fellowship and reaching out," every September. You wouldn't want to miss the Pasigarbo event, where the streets are full of drumbeats and dancing.
					<br>And of course, Pasundayag, where different stories of the city's traditions are narrated through dancing. The roads are overcrowded during this time, so make sure to keep your essential belongings near you.</p></ul></li>
			<ul><li>Buglasan Festival<p>In the middle of October every year, they celebrate the Buglasan Festival, popularly known as "The Festival of Festivals." It's a province-wide event that runs for ten days. Aside from exciting activities, you can witness street dancing and showdowns every 3rd Friday of October.
					<br>Most of the establishments are open during this time. Bring your family and friends! You'll get a taste of Dumaguete culture at this festival.</p></ul></li>
		

            <h2>Climate and Weather</h2>
            <p>Before visiting, make sure to check weather updates as this will help plan itinerary better. It will also help in knowing what you have to wear on specific days.</p>

			<p>The province is known to be a tropical destination, with an average annual temperature of 28°C. May is the warmest month at around 29°C, while January is the month with the lowest temperature, at approximately 26°C. </p>
			
			<h2>What to do in Dumaguete</h2>
			<p>While the streets are always busy, one can feel the laid back attitude of all Dumagueteños as soon as stepping onto the street. When coming from a big City the most important thing to do is to slow down. 
			After one successfully masters this task, it is time for a leisurely walk through downtown Dumaguete. When starting your City Tour at the Belfry Clock Tower, don’t forget to light a petition candle, or two. 
			After that, you are ready to check out the Saint Catherine of Alexandria Cathedral just next to it.</p>

			<p>Stroll through Quezon Park down to the Rizal Boulevard. The 1 km long boulevard at the waterfront is perfect for breathing the original Dumaguete lifestyle. Watch all generations enjoying their time together. 
			Get some local delicacies from the vendors or have a bit to eat at one of the many restaurants located there.
			<br>Continue north and you can see the famous Silliman University at the north end of the Boulevard. Take a left turn into Silliman Avenue. After a few minutes you reach Silliman’s Portal West where you enter the 
			acacia lined campus. The Campus is a tourist attraction itself. However, don’t miss the Silliman Library and the Anthropology Museum. If one is not tired yet, just head to Freedom Park, where the government of 
			Negros Oriental is located.</p>

			<p>When the culture and sightseeing part is done, it is shopping time. Get your Dumaguete souvenirs in one of the handicraft shops downtown, find a street vendor, which engraves your name in a necklace or head to one 
			of the bigger shopping center for a Dumaguete Souvenir T-Shirt. Your trip to Dumaguete would not be complete if you only limit it to the city. There are a lot of tourist attractions in Negros Oriental to discover.</p>
